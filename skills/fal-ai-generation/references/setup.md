# Connect fal.ai in another project

Copy the complete `fal-ai-generation` folder into that project's Claude or Codex
skill directory. Keep one canonical copy if both agents use it. No Mr. Mak
repository, original account or private project folder is required.

## Account and MCP

Create your own API key in the [fal dashboard](https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys).
Use the inference/API scope unless your task needs account administration.
Connect a Streamable HTTP MCP server at `https://mcp.fal.ai/mcp`, with an
`Authorization` header whose value is `Bearer <your key>`.

Use your client's environment/header support so a real key is not committed.
In Mr. Mak, the project `.env` can contain `MRMAK_MCP_FAL_AUTHORIZATION` with the
complete Bearer value; new agent sessions receive this explicitly scoped value.
Claude's shared `.mcp.json` references `${MRMAK_MCP_FAL_AUTHORIZATION}` and Codex's
project config uses `env_http_headers`. A standalone terminal must load the
variable before starting its agent. A root `.env` is not automatically read by
every MCP client. Merge into an existing config instead of replacing its servers.

Do not confuse `https://docs.fal.ai/mcp`, a documentation connection, with the
generation MCP. Client support changes; follow the current
[official connection guide](https://fal.ai/docs/documentation/setting-up/mcp).
Confirm tools such as `get_model_schema` in the intended agent session. A config
file alone does not prove a live connection. Listing tools or reading a schema
does not require creating an image.

## Optional Python helper

Use Python 3.10+ and install the small dependency file from this skill directory:

```text
python -m pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
python scripts/fal_job.py --help
```

Set `FAL_KEY` in the environment or in your project's ignored `.env`. The helper
also understands legacy `FALAI_KEY` and Mr. Mak's scoped MCP Bearer variable.
Choose a file explicitly with `--env /path/to/project/.env`; otherwise only the
current working directory's `.env` is considered. Credentials are never printed.

```text
python scripts/fal_job.py submit --endpoint fal-ai/nano-banana-pro --input examples/concept.json --out output/concept --dry-run
```

The dry run does not import the SDK, upload files, contact fal or create a paid
job. An actual `submit` uses account credits. The examples do not include keys.

Keep job receipts, reference uploads and generated media in the recipient's own
task directory. When sharing the skill again, share its clean source folder,
not a working directory containing `.env` or private receipts.
